# Final-Exam---Process-CSV-files

Part I. Data and Setup 

  1.	Import numpy, pandas, visualization libraries
  2.	Create timer and include time measure for all questions from Part II.
  3.	Read in three csv files and print first five lines of each of them.

Part II. Basic Questions

  4.	Code the function to calculate how many passengers pay through each type of payment types.
  5.	Code function to find min, max, mean of the cost for 1 trips on the given day of the specific month (only use the dropoff time).
  6.	Code the function to count how many trips that drop off at the midnight (11 PM to 1 AM) on the given day of the specific month.

Part III. Sort algorithm

  7.	Write your own ascending sort function and sort values in fare_amount column on the given day of the specific month then display the negative amount payment and count how many values under 10$

Part IV. Search algorithm 

  8.	Code the function to search and return number of passengers that tip drivers in four levels (no tips, under 3$, between 3$ and 5$, above 5$) and display the highest tip amount.
  9.	Code the function to find the three longest trips (longest durations) on the given day of the specific month and calculate their average velocity (km/h).

Part V. Draw chart 

  10.	 If the first day of the duration of this dataset was Monday, write a function to count number of trips on each weekday and then draw a chart to demonstrate them.
