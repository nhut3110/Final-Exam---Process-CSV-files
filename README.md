# Final-Exam---Process-CSV-files
This is the first idea for 10 questions:
  01. Import numpy, pandas, visualization libraries; read in three csv files; check the infomation of these files; create timer and include time measure for all questions below.
  02. Write your own ascending sort function and then sort these dataframes by passenger count.
  03. Code the function to calculate how many passengers pay through the first type of payment type
  04. Code the function to draw chart for passenger count
  05. Draw two charts for Vendor ID and passenger count.
  06. Code function to find min, max, mean of the cost for 1 trips.
  07. Code the function to count how many trips that drop off at the midnight (11 PM to 1 AM).
  08. Code the function to find the three longest and three shortest trip distances.
  09. Code the function to search and return number of passengers that tip drivers in three levels ( under 5$, between 5$ and 10$, above 10$)
  10. If the first day of the duration of this dataset was Monday, write a function to count number of weekdays and then draw a chart demonstrating the number of trips on each weekday.
