# I. About the project:

This project is a final project for Introduction to Computer Science class. It processes CSV files mainly by Pandas in Python at the beginning level.

> In this project, I aim to:
  >> + Read different CSV files
  >> + Brainstorm questions and problems that need to solve through CSV files
  >> + Research and program to solve these problems
  >> + Fix bugs and improve code

> This project only work for the three given CSV files linked below.

> Make sure you read everything below and you can contact me if you have any questions or feedback.

## 1. Installation:

Matplotlib.pyplot:
   
       pip install matplotlib.pyplot
       conda install matplotlib.pyplot (if you use conda)
       
Numpy:
 
        pip install numpy
        conda install numpy (if you use conda)
        
Pandas:
        
        pip install pandas
        conda install pandas (if you use conda)

## 2. Data:

In this project, we will process CSV files in three different levels which are small, medium and large.

| File | Description |
| ------:| -----------:|
| Small File  |  10.000 lines|
| Medium File |  1.000.000 lines |
| Large File  |  23.000.000 lines |

You can download three CSV files from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ahXRcYFtZsIjejRV7jhZSPIIYvZuTpMY?usp=sharing).

## VI. Questions:
```
Ten questions can be divided into three levels 'Easy'(E), 'Medium'(M), 'Hard'(H).

Part I. Data and Setup (Easy)

    01. Import numpy, pandas, visualization libraries. (E)

    02. Create timer and include time measure for all questions from Part II. (E)

    03. Read in three csv files and print first five lines of each of them. (E)

Part II. Basic Questions (Easy)

    04. Code the function to calculate how many passengers pay through each type of payment types. (E)

    05. Code function to find min, max, mean of the cost for 1 trips on the given day of the specific month (only use the dropoff time). (E)

    06. Code the function to count how many trips that drop off at the midnight (11 PM to 1 AM) on the given day of the specific month. (E)

Part III. Sort algorithm (Medium)

    07. Write your own ascending sort function and sort values in fare_amount column on the given day of the specific month then display the negative amount payment and count how many values under 10$. (M)

Part IV. Search algorithm (Medium and Hard)

    08. Code the function to search and return number of passengers that tip drivers in four levels (no tips, under 3$, between 3$ and 5$, above 5$) and display the highest tip amount. (M)

    09. Code the function tofind the three longest trips (longest durations) on the given day of the specific month and calculate their average velocity (m/s). (H)

Part V. Draw chart (Hard)

    10. If the first day of the duration of this dataset (only use the dropoff time) was Monday, write a function to count number of trips on each weekday and then draw a chart to demonstrate them. (H)

## V. Instructors:

Thank you Mr. Vu and Mr. Thien for the support and give us a wonderful challenges to improve our coding skill and use the python library better. Thank you very much and we hope we can get more challenge to improve our coding more and more.
